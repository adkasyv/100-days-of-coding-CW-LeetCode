Beginner Series #4 Cockroach

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 --> 30

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.


---solution
function cockroachSpeed(s) {
  return Math.floor(1000 * s / 3600 * 100)
}

cockroachSpeed(1.08)
