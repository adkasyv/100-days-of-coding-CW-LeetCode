Short Long Short

short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty ( zero length ).

Hint for R users:

    The length of string is not always the same as the number of characters

For example: (Input1, Input2) --> output

("1", "22") --> "1221"
("22", "1") --> "1221"

  --solution

function solution(a, b){
  let shorter = a.length < b.length ? a : b; 
  let longer = a.length < b.length ? b : a;
  return shorter + longer + shorter
}
