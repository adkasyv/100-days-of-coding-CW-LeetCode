Given a list of directions to spin, "left" or "right", return an integer of how many full 360° rotations were made. Note that each word in the array counts as a 90° rotation in that direction.

Worked Example
["right", "right", "right", "right", "left", "right"] ➞ 1
# You spun right 4 times (90 * 4 = 360)
# You spun left once (360 - 90 = 270)
# But you spun right once more to make a full rotation (270 + 90 = 360)

function spinAround(directions) {
  let totalRotation = 0;

  for (let direction of directions) {
    if (direction === "right") {
      totalRotation += 90;
    } else if (direction === "left") {
      totalRotation -= 90;
    }
  }

  const fullRotations = Math.floor(Math.abs(totalRotation) / 360);
  return fullRotations;
}
